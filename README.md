[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/en-japan-air/enscalator.svg?token=hzDTonLsrtFjB1EvbfNy&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/en-japan-air/enscalator)
[![Coverage Status](***REMOVED***c)](***REMOVED***)

Enscalator is based on [bazaarvoice/cloudformation-ruby-dsl](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/cloudformation-ruby-dsl) 
and helps cloudforming en-japan applications

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'enscalator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install enscalator

$> enscalator -c -t Interaction \
-r us-west-1 \
-s Interaction \
-n enjapan-vpc \
-p 'CouchbaseInteractionKeyName=test;WebServerPort=9000'
```

> Note: if you'd like to run enscalator without installing it as gem, use `./exe/enscalator` script.

### Where did you put my ssh keys to?

All autogenerated ssh keys gets saved to directory corresponding to selected profile name
under `$HOME/.enscalator`, thus

* when no profile option was given, keys would be saved to `$HOME/.enscalator/default`
* for specific profile, directory would be created and keys would be saved under `$HOME/.enscalator/%profile_name%`

### How to write a template
Templates are stored in `lib/enscalator/templates/`.  
When your template is done you need to `require_relative` it in `lib/enscalator.rb/templates.rb`.

You'll find the list of helpers you can use in:

* `lib/enscalator/richtemplate.rb`
* `lib/enscalator/enapp.rb`
* `lib/enscalator/helpers.rb` (and more generic helpers)

For each template you write you'll automatically get a ResourceSecurityGroup, an ApplicationSecurityGroup, 
a ResourceSubnetA/ResourceSubnetB, ApplicationSubnetA/ApplicationSubnetB, and a loadBalancer. 
Everything gets attached to a `VPC`, that was created using `enjapan_vpc` template.
That's why you always need to precise the start_ip_idx as a parameter of basic_setup,
it's the starting ip address in the subnet.

Check [lib/enscalator/templates/auth_service.rb](lib/enscalator/templates/auth_service.rb) for an example.


### How to write a plugin and include it?
Plugins are modules and stored in `lib/enscalator/plugins/`.  
When you want to use your plugin you just have to `include PluginName` inside your template.
See `lib/enscalator/template/jobposting.rb` for an example.  
Don't forget to `require_relative` your new plugin in `lib/enscalator/plugins.rb`.

Plugins supported out of the box:

* [auto_scale](lib/enscalator/plugins/auto_scale.rb)
* [core_os](lib/enscalator/plugins/core_os.rb)
* [couchbase](lib/enscalator/plugins/couchbase.rb)
* [elasticsearch](lib/enscalator/plugins/elasticsearch.rb)
* [elb](lib/enscalator/plugins/elb.rb)
* [rds](lib/enscalator/plugins/rds.rb)
* [rethinkdb](lib/enscalator/plugins/rethinkdb.rb)
* [ubuntu](lib/enscalator/plugins/ubuntu.rb)

#### What's pre_run and post_run?
**pre_run** is a method called **BEFORE** the template generation. It's a good place to make some calls to the AWS SDK for instance.  
**post_run** is a method called **AFTER** the stack is created. It's a good place to create some DNS records in route53 for instance.

## Notes

There are number of plugins with pure magic:

* Ubuntu plugin in [lib/enscalator/plugins/ubuntu.rb](lib/enscalator/plugins/ubuntu.rb). 
It'll automatically get the AMIs ID from the ubuntu website.

* CoreOS plugin in [lib/enscalator/plugins/core_os.rb](lib/enscalator/plugins/core_os.rb).
It would not only fetch AMI IDs, but also can do that from multiple release channels.

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle && bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` 
to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, 
and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Documentation

To generate documentation run `rake doc` ( or `bundle exec rake doc` )

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Check if tests failing (`rake spec` or `bundle exec rake spec`)
